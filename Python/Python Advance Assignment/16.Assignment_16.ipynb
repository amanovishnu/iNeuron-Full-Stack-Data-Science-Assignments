    "#### Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "**Ans:** Regular Expressions, also known as **`regex`** or **`regexp`**, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. it helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. it also avoids multiple use of **`if/else`** statements."

    "**Ans:** Both **`(ab)c+`** and **`a(bc)+`** are valid patterns. the difference between both these patterns is in **`(ab)c+`** **`ab`** is group whereas in **`a(bc)+`** **`bc`** is a group."

    "#### Q6. What are some examples of how to use the match object returned by re.match and re.search?\n",
    "**Ans:** The **`re.search()`** and **`re.match()`** both are functions of re module in python. These functions are very efficient and fast for searching in strings. The function searches for some substring in a string and returns a match object if found, else it returns none.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a difference between the use of both functions. Both return the first match of a substring found in the string, but **`re.match()`** searches only from the beginning of the string and return match object if found. But if a match of substring is found somewhere in the middle of the string, it returns none. \n",
    "\n",
    "While **`re.search()`** searches for the whole string even if the string contains multi-lines and tries to find a match of the substring in all the lines of string"
