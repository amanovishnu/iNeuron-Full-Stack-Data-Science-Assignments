    "#### Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "**Ans:** Encapsulation describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an objects variable can only be changed by an objects method."

    "**Ans:** Entering **`__radd__`** Python will first try **`__add__()`**, and if that returns Not Implemented Python will check if the right-hand operand implements **`__radd__`**, and if it does, it will call **`__radd__()`** rather than raising a **`TypeError`**"

    "**Ans:** Reflection method we often encounter the requirement that a method in the executing object, or a variable in the calling object, or a field of the object should be assigned, while the method name or field name can not be determined when encoding the code, and need to be input in the form of passing strings through parameters."
