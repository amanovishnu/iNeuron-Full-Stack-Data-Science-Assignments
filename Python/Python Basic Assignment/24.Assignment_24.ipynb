    "#### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "**Ans:** `def` statement is used to create a normal function. where as `lamba` expressions are used to create `Anonymous functions`. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we'd put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement. "

    "1. Can be used to create Nameless/Anonymous functions inside some complex functions if we are planning to use it only once.\n",
    "2. Moderate to small functions can be created in a single line\n",
    "3. Fuctions created using lambda expressions can be assigned to a variable and can be used by simply calling the variable"

    "#### 3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "**Ans:** The differences between map, filter and reduce are: \n",
    "1. `map()`: The map() function is a type of higher-order. This function takes another function as a parameter\n",
    "along with a sequence of iterables and returns an output after applying the function to each iterable present in the\n",
    "sequence. \n",
    "2. `filter()`: The filter() function is used to create an output list consisting of values for which the function returns true.\n",
    "3. `reduce()`: The reduce() function, as the name describes, applies a given function to the iterables and returns a single value"

    "2. avoid using or limited use of global variables\n",

    "5. Avoid using digits while choosing a variable name\n",
    "6. try to use a name for the function which conveys the purpose of the function\n",
    "7. Local variables should be named using camelCase format `(ex: localVariable)` whereas Global variables names should be using PascalCase `(ex:GlobalVariable)`. \n",
