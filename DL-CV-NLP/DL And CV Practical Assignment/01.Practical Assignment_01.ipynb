    "##### Objective: - Image Classification with CIFAR 100\n",
    "This dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a \"fine\" label (the class to which it belongs) and a \"coarse\" label (the superclass to which it belongs).\n",

    "The dataset is not direct images. Please decode it using your own techniques.\n",
    "#####  Task:\n",
    "Create a Web Application using Flask. Use the end user should be able to upload an image and get results with the prediction score.\n",
