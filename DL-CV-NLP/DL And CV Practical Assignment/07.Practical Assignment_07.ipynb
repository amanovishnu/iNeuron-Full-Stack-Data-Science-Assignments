    "##### Objective: Object Detection with OpenImages\n",
    "Open Images is a new dataset first released in 2016 that contains ~9 million images – which is fewer than ImageNet. What makes it stand out is that these images are mostly of complex scenes that span thousands of classes of objects. Moreover, ~2 million of these images are hand-annotated with bounding boxes making Open Images by far the largest existing dataset with object location annotations. In this subset of images, there are ~15.4 million bounding boxes of 600 classes of object.\n",
    "##### Dataset Link:\n",
    "Dataset is pretty big. SO we do not want to train it completely. So please extract any 10 classes images and annotations that you like. Then train it.\n",
    "##### Link :\n",
    "https://github.com/cvdfoundation/open-images-dataset\n",
    "##### Task:\n",
    "Create a Web Application using Flask. Use the end user should be able to upload an image and get results with the prediction score. Use any CNN architecture launched after 2017.\n",
    "##### Deployment:\n",
    "Any Free Platform(Try to look out for free options.)\n",
    "##### Assignment Submission:\n",
    "Only submit the hosted app link. OR GitHub Link"
