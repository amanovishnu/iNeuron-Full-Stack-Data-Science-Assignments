    "**Ans:** There are Five core tasks in the common ML workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get Data: The first step in the Machine Learning process is getting data.\n",
    "- Cleaning, Preparing & Manipulating Data: Real-world data often has unorganized, missing, or noisy elements.\n",
    "- Train Model: This step is where the magic happens!\n",
    "- Testing Model.\n",
    "- Improving model.\n",
    "- Data preprocessing involves transforming raw data to well-formed data sets so that data mining analytics can be applied. \n",
    "- Preprocessing involves both data validation and data imputation\n",
    "- The Goal of Data Validation is to assess whether the data in question is both complete and accurate.\n",
    "- The Goal of Data Imputation is to correct errors and input missing values, Either Manually or Automatically through business process automation (BPA) programming."

    "**Ans:** The following is a basic data collection that includes some sample records.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determine What Information You Want to Collect:** The first thing you need to do is choose what details you want to collect. You’ll need to decide what topics the information will cover, who you want to collect it from and how much data you need. Your goals — what you hope to accomplish using your data — will determine your answers to these questions. As an example, you may decide to collect data about which type of articles are most popular on your website among visitors who are between the ages of 18 and 34. You might also choose to gather information about the average age of all of the customers who bought a product from your company within the last month.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set a Timeframe for Data Collection:** Next, you can start formulating your plan for how you’ll collect your data. In the early stages of your planning process, you should establish a timeframe for your data collection. You may want to gather some types of data continuously. When it comes to transactional data and website visitor data, for example, you may want to set up a method for tracking that data over the long term. If you’re tracking data for a specific  campaign, however, you’ll track it over a defined period. In these instances, you’ll have a schedule for when you’ll start and end your data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine Your Data Collection Method:** At this step, you will choose the data collection method that will make up  the core of your data-gathering strategy. To select the right collection method, you’ll need to consider the type of  information you want to collect, the timeframe over which you’ll obtain it and the other aspects you determined. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collect the Data:** Once you have finalized your plan, you can implement your data collection strategy and start collecting data. You can store and organize your data in your DMP. Be sure to stick to your plan and check on its progress regularly. It may be useful to create a schedule for when you will check in with how your data collection is proceeding, especially if you are collecting data continuously. You may want to make updates to your plan as conditions change and you get new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analyze the Data and Implement Your Findings:** Once you’ve collected all of your data, it’s time to analyze it and organize your findings. The analysis phase is crucial because it turns raw data into valuable insights that you can use to enhance your marketing strategies, products and business decisions. You can use the analytics tools built into our DMP to help with this step. Once you’ve uncovered the patterns and insights in your data, you can implement the findings to improve your business."

    "2. **Frequency Count:** Frequency count is finding how frequent individual values occur in column.\n",
    "3. **Variance:** Variance gives a good indication how the values are spread.\n",
    "4. **Pareto Analysis:** Pareto analysis is a creative way of focusing on what is important. Pareto 80–20 rule can be effectively used in data exploration.\n",
    "5. **Histogram:** Histogram are one of the data scientists favourite data exploration techniques. It gives information on the range of values in which most of the values fall. It also gives information on whether there is any skew in data.\n",
    "6. **Correlation Heat-map between all numeric columns:** The term correlation refers to a mutual relationship or association between two things.\n",
    "7. **Pearson Correlation and Trend between two numeric columns:** Once you have visualised correlation heat-map , the next step is to see the correlation trend between two specific numeric columns.\n",
    "8. **Outlier overview:** Finding something unusual in data is called Outlier detection (also known as anomaly detection). These outliers represent something unusual, rare , anomaly or something exceptional. "

The popular methods which are used by the machine learning community to handle the missing value for categorical variables in the dataset are as follows: Delete the observations: If there is a large number of observations in the dataset, where all the classes to be predicted are sufficiently represented in the training data, then try deleting the missing value observations, which would not bring significant change in your feed to your model."
