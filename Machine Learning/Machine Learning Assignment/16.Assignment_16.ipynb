    "**Ans:** Algebraically, a linear equation typically takes the form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants, x is the independent variable, y is the dependent variable. The slope tells us how the dependent variable (y) changes for every one unit increase in the independent (x) variable, on average.\n",

    "**Ans:** Simple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line. Both variables should be quantitative. Linear regression most often uses mean-square error (MSE) to calculate the error of the model.\n",

    "For example, suppose that height was the only determinant of body weight.In this example, if an individual was 70  inches tall, we would predict his weight to be: `Weight = 80 + 2 x (70) = 220 lbs`. In this simple linear regression, we are examining the impact of one independent variable on the outcome."

    "**Ans:** The slope of a regression line (b) represents the rate of change in y as x changes. Because y is dependent on x, the slope describes the predicted values of y given x. The slope must be calculated before the y-intercept when using a linear regression, as the intercept is calculated using the slope."
