    "\n",
    "**Under the supervision of experts:** Human-guided machine learning is a process whereby subject matter experts accelerate the learning process by teaching the technology in real-time. For example, if the machine learning model comes across a piece of data it is uncertain about, a human can be asked to weigh in and give feedback. The model then learns from this input, and uses it to make a more accurate prediction the next time. Human-guided machine learning works from the bottom up by first using algorithms to conduct the heavy lifting of identifying relationships within the data, and engaging humans when necessary for training or validation `Concept Learning`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**With the assistance of experts in an indirect manner:** Well The process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance `Operant Conditioning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self education:** Ability to recognize patterns, learn from data, and become more intelligent over time (can be AI or programmatically  based).Machine Learning: AI systems with ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed via training `Hebbian Learning`."

    "for each observation represent the features of that observation and their values.At the outset of a machine learning project, a dataset is usually split into two or three subsets. The minimum subsets are the training and test datasets, and often an optional third validation dataset is created as well. Once these data subsets are created from the primary  dataset, a predictive model or classifier is trained using the training data, and then the model’s predictive accuracy is determined using the test data. As, machine learning leverages algorithms to automatically model and find patternsin data, usually with the goal of predicting some target output or response. These algorithms are heavily based on statistics and mathematical optimization. Optimization is the process of finding the smallest or largest value (minima or maxima) of a function, often referred to as a loss, or cost function in the minimization case. One of the  most popular optimization algorithms used in machine learning is called gradient descent, and another is known as the  the normal equation. In a nutshell, machine learning is all about automatically learning a highly accurate predictive or classifier model, or finding unknown patterns in data, by leveraging learning algorithms and optimization techniques.\n",
