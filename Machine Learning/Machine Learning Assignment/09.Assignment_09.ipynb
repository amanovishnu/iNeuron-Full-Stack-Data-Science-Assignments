Feature engineering consists of creation, transformation, extraction, and selection of features, also known as variables, that are most conducive to creating an accurate ML algorithm."

    "The filter method has the fastest running time; however, it does not consider feature dependencies and tends to each feature separately when univariate techniques are used. The wrapper method has the advantages of better  generalization and robust interaction with the classifier used for feature selection"
