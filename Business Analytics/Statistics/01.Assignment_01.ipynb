Both are held in the same lecture hall (which has 100 seats), and the seating is uniformly random and independent for the two courses ?\n",

The first passenger in line crazily decides to sit in a randomly chosen seat (with all seats equally likely). Each subsequent passenger takes his or her assigned seat if available, and otherwise sits in a random available seat. What is the probability that the last passenger in line gets to sit in his or her assigned seat?"
