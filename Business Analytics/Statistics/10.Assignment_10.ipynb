    "#### 1.\tA chicken lays n eggs. Each egg independently does or doesn’t hatch, with probability p of hatching. For each egg that hatches, the chick does or doesn’t survive (independently of the other eggs), with probability s of survival. Let N ⇠ Bin(n, p) be the number of eggs which hatch, X be the number of chicks which survive, and Y be the number of chicks which hatch but don’t survive (so X + Y = N). Find the marginal PMF of X, and the joint PMF of X and Y . Are they independent ?"
